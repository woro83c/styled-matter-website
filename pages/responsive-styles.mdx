# Responsive styles

Common to utility-first frameworks is the ability to quickly set responsive styles directly in your markup. It's an approach that works really well to begin with, but as complexity increases - especially across breakpoints - markup can become bloated and hard to read.

Enter CSS **expressions**.

Using the `<Button>` element from our previous example, let's try to make it more responsive. As the screen widens, we want to:

- Increase its font size, and
- Increase its padding

While this is a slightly contrived example, here's how one might achieve this using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

```jsx
<Button className="bg-primary text-white inline-block md:text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold px-6 py-3 lg:px-7 lg:py-4 rounded-4">
  Get started
</Button>
```

As you can see, it can be hard to tell what's going on here. Each utility is one of _many_ making up the salad. We can do much better though.

Using CSS expressions, we can target any or all breakpoints with a single style prop. We do it by passing a string literal containing values _separated by commas_ - with each comma representing the gap between breakpoints:

```diff
<Button
  bg="primary"
  color="white"
  display="inline-block"
+ fontSize=",,lg,xl"
  fontWeight="bold"
- px={7}
- py={4}
+ px="6,,,7"
+ py="3,,,4"
  rounded={4}
>
  Get started
</Button>
```

Using this syntax, we quickly get a feel for how this will look across breakpoints. Specifically, we can see:

- Font size increasing at the 2nd and 3rd breakpoints, and
- Padding increasing at the 3rd

## Escaping values

Due to the use of commas when separating values, _values containing commas_ must be wrapped in **single quotes** in order for them to be properly recognized.

üëç Styled Matter will **correctly** recognize a single value here:

```jsx
<Button bg="'rgb(255, 0, 255)'">
  Yep
</Button>
```

üëé Styled Matter will **incorrectly** recognize three values here, i.e., `rgb(255`, `0`, and `255)`:

```jsx
<Button bg="rgb(255, 0, 255)">
  Nope
</Button>
```
