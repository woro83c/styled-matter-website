# Embeds

[Composing components can be tricky](https://css-tricks.com/considerations-for-creating-a-card-component/), and refactoring a component for the sake of a one-off customization can be especially annoying. Using **embeds** though, we can remedy this.

Using a `<Card>` component as a base, let's assume we need to customize its inner link elements. To do this, start by adding some CSS classes to its link elements to serve as identifiers for later.

```diff
function Card({ children, ...rest }) {
  return (
    <Div {...rest}>
      <Img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" alt="">
      <H5>Card title</H5>

      {children}

-     <A href="#">Card link</A>
-     <A href="#">Another link</A>
+     <A href="#" className="link card-link">Card link</A>
+     <A href="#" className="link another-link">Another link</A>
    </Div>
  )
}
```

Using these classes, we can now reach within our `<Card>` component to customize each of its inner link elements - here's how:

## Embedding elements

_An embed element is simply a JSX element that overrides one or more other JSX elements._

To embed an element, pass it as a prop just like any other - except its prop name must be made up of a _selector_ prepended by a single dollar symbol ($).

Here's how it should look when selecting our `.card-link` to be overridden:

```jsx
<Card
  $card-link={(
    <Tooltip id="my-tooltip" title="My tooltip">
      <A href="#">My link</A>
    </Tooltip>
  )}
/>
```

Similarly - using the `link` class - we can override _all_ link elements while still leaning on their initial props:

```jsx
<Card
  $link={({ key, ...rest }) => (
    <Tooltip id={key} title={rest.children}>
      <A {...rest} />
    </Tooltip>
  )}
/>
```

Furthermore, we can also:

```jsx
// Override their props only
<Card $link={{ color: 'white' }} />

// Replace them all with strings (or numbers)
<Card $link="My text" />

// Remove them all entirely
<Card $link={null} />
```

VoilÃ ! No refactor required ðŸ˜Ž

## Selectors

Styled Matter also ships with some predefined psuedo-class selectors to save you the hassle of adding class names for some of the more common embed locations. The following selectors have been made available to direct descendants only:

```jsx
// First and last children
<Content $first-child={{ mt: 0 }} $last-child={{ mb: 0 }} />

// Odds and evens
<Content $odd-child={{ bg: 'white' }} $even-child={{ bg: 'light' }} />

// Before and after
<Content $before={<Lead>Paragraph.</Lead>} $after={<Pagination />} />
```

### Multiple matches

In the case of the first example above, if the component were to only have the one child, both embed selectors would match the one element. In this case specifically - where only props are supplied - Styled Matter is smart enough to merge these props together. If both were to supply the same prop though, the latter would override the former.

If an element _is_ supplied though, this will trump any props that have been supplied. When multiple elements are supplied to override a single element, again, the latter will override the former.

## Responsive embeds

Sometimes markup needs to be completely different based on viewport width, e.g., imagine we want to show tabs on mobile versus a table on desktop. Using responsive embeds we can render elements _only_ at certain breakpoints. We do this by using breakpoint _indices_ as selectors:

```jsx
// Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3
const breakpoints = [0, '48em', '64em', '80em']

render(
  <DefaultComponent
    $1={<Div>Showing a div at 48em</Div>}
    $2={<Span>Showing a span at 64em</Span>}
    $3={<PricingTable $before="Showing the pricing table at 80em" />}
  />
)
```
